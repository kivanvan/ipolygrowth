#'@details This package calculates growth curve parameters using fourth degree polynomial functions.
#'The package was developed for bacterial growth experiments.
#'Thus, data from microplate readers serve as the input data format for R functions in this package.
#'Polynomial growth curves are estimated from time series data from a single biological sample or multiple samples.
#'Technical replicates within biological samples are allowed.
#'Output includes six calculated growth curve parameters: peak growth rate, peak growth time, doubling time at peak growth, lag time, max y, and max y time.
