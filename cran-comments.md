## Resubmission--0.1.2

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added details about the package functionality and implemented method.

* There is no reference now. We plan to refer the CRAN package page in our method paper and will add it in the next submission when the package needs an update. For now, the method is briefly described in the documentation of `ipg_singlesample()`. 


## Resubmission--0.1.1

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Used canonical form for CRAN URLs.


## R CMD check results
