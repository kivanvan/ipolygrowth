Description: Calculation of key bacterial growth curve parameters using fourth degree polynomial functions. 
    Six growth curve parameters are provided including peak growth rate, doubling time, lag time, maximum growth, and etc.
    'ipolygrowth' takes time series data from individual biological samples (with technical replicates) or multiple samples.
